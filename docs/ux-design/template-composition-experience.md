## üö® Outstanding Questions & Decisions

[ALWAYS UPDATE THIS SECTION FIRST - Move resolved items to their respective discussion sections]

### Awaiting User Input

**All questions from Session 1 have been answered! New questions based on Session 2 decisions:**

#### Template Versioning System Architecture
1. **Version history display**: Where should version history be accessible?
   - In sidebar panel (new section)
   - In template metadata editor (existing modal)
   - In "Template Insights" panel (repurposed outline)
   - Dedicated "History" tab when template is open

2. **Version comparison**: How should users compare versions?
   - Side-by-side diff view (like GitHub)
   - Inline diff with additions/deletions highlighted
   - Full restore preview before confirming

3. **Version auto-save vs manual**: Should every change create a version, or only manual saves?
   - Auto-version on every save (easier, but cluttered)
   - Manual "Create Version" button (explicit, but requires user action)
   - Hybrid: Auto-save + optional "Mark as Version" with notes

4. **Version retention**: How long to keep version history?
   - Unlimited (storage grows over time)
   - Last 30 versions (prevents clutter)
   - Time-based: Last 90 days

#### Template Analytics Implementation
5. **Analytics display location**: Where should analytics be most visible?
   - Template card footer (always visible in sidebar)
   - Template Insights panel (when template is open)
   - Dedicated Analytics Dashboard page
   - All of the above (redundant but comprehensive)

6. **Response tracking UX**: How should users enter campaign responses?
   - Modal prompt: "How many responses did {{template_name}} get today?"
   - Inline input in template card
   - Dedicated "Campaign Tracker" view
   - Semi-automated reminder (shows X hours after template was used)

7. **Response reminder timing**: When to prompt for response count?
   - 4 hours after template used
   - End of business day (5pm)
   - Next morning (9am)
   - User-configurable

8. **Analytics exportability**: Should analytics be exportable?
   - CSV export (for Excel analysis)
   - PDF report (for presentations)
   - Both
   - Not needed

#### Tab Grouping System
9. **Tab grouping strategy**: How should tabs be grouped?
   - Manual: User creates groups and assigns tabs
   - Automatic: By campaign tag (requires tag on template)
   - Automatic: By date opened (today, this week, older)
   - Hybrid: Auto-group by tag, with manual override

10. **Tab group UI pattern**: How should groups be displayed?
    - Vertical tabs with group headers (like VS Code)
    - Separate tab rows per group
    - Color-coded tabs (different color per group)
    - Dropdown menu per group

11. **Tab group persistence**: Should groups persist across sessions?
    - Yes, save to localStorage (persists across browser restarts)
    - Session-only (resets on app close)
    - User choice (toggle in settings)

#### Folder + Tag Hybrid System
12. **Primary navigation method**: Should folders or tags be primary?
    - Folders primary, tags secondary (familiar for users)
    - Tags primary, folders optional (current system)
    - Equal weight (sidebar shows both)

13. **Folder structure**: How deep should folders go?
    - Flat (no nesting, just categories)
    - 2 levels (e.g., "Sales" ‚Üí "Auto Insurance")
    - Unlimited nesting (full tree structure)

14. **Folder + tag interaction**: How do folders and tags work together?
    - Tags filter within current folder
    - Folders and tags are independent (both filter global list)
    - Tags can span folders (e.g., #urgent tag shows templates from all folders)

#### Custom Variable Creation Flow
15. **Variable creation location**: Where should users create custom variables?
    - In template editor (inline, as-needed)
    - In dedicated "Variable Manager" (centralized)
    - Both (inline for quick, manager for organized)

16. **Custom variable required fields**: What info is needed to create a variable?
    - Name only (minimal)
    - Name + label (display name)
    - Name + label + description + example (comprehensive)

17. **Custom variable validation**: Should variable names be validated?
    - Alphanumeric + underscore only (strict)
    - Allow spaces (converted to underscores)
    - No validation (user responsibility)

18. **Custom variable scope**: Where are custom variables available?
    - Global (available in all templates)
    - Template-specific (only in the template where created)
    - User choice on creation (toggle "Make available in all templates")

#### Template Approval Workflow
19. **Approval submission process**: How do users submit templates for approval?
    - Button in template metadata: "Submit to Agency Templates"
    - Context menu on template card: "Share with Agency"
    - Dedicated "Share" modal with message to approver

20. **Approval UI for managers**: Where do team leads review submissions?
    - "Pending Approvals" section in sidebar
    - Separate "Template Approvals" page
    - Email notification with approve/reject links (external)

21. **Approval notifications**: How are users notified of approval status?
    - In-app notification banner
    - Toast message on next login
    - Email notification
    - All of the above

22. **Approval feedback loop**: Can approvers suggest changes?
    - Yes, with inline comments
    - Yes, with rejection message only
    - No, just approve/reject

#### Keyboard Shortcuts Enhancement
23. **Additional shortcuts needed**: Based on your list (Tab, Enter, Ctrl+S, Ctrl+K, /, arrows), what else is needed?
    - Ctrl+N: New template
    - Ctrl+D: Duplicate template
    - Ctrl+F: Find in template content
    - Ctrl+Shift+V: Open variable picker
    - Esc: Close current panel/modal

24. **Keyboard shortcut customization**: Should users customize shortcuts?
    - Yes, fully customizable (settings panel)
    - No, keep consistent for all users (easier support)

#### Screen Reader Support Specifics
25. **Screen reader priority areas**: Which areas need screen reader support FIRST?
    - Template editor (most critical)
    - Template sidebar navigation
    - Variable insertion and editing
    - All of the above (comprehensive)

26. **ARIA requirements**: What level of ARIA implementation?
    - Basic: Landmarks and labels only
    - Standard: WCAG 2.1 AA (required for most vendors)
    - Advanced: WCAG 2.1 AAA (exceeds most requirements)

#### Recently Closed Tabs Recovery
27. **Recently closed access method**: How should users access closed tabs?
    - Keyboard shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+T (like browsers)
    - Context menu on tab bar: "Reopen Closed Tab"
    - "Recently Closed" section in sidebar
    - All of the above

28. **Recently closed retention**: How many closed tabs to remember?
    - Last 10 (typical browser behavior)
    - Last 20 (power user friendly)
    - Unlimited during session (clears on app close)

29. **Recently closed persistence**: Should closed tabs persist across sessions?
    - Yes, save to localStorage (persist across restarts)
    - No, session-only (clears on app close)

30. **Recently closed display**: How should closed tabs be displayed?
    - List with template name + close time
    - List with template name + preview
    - Grouped by when closed (today, yesterday, this week)

#### Word Count vs Character Count
31. **Primary metric**: Should word count be the ONLY metric?
    - Word count only (simplest, aligns with preference)
    - Word count + character count (comprehensive)
    - Word count + reading time estimate (e.g., "~30 sec read")

32. **Metric display location**: Where should word count be displayed?
    - Editor footer (always visible while editing)
    - Template Insights panel (when template is open)
    - Template card (in sidebar preview)
    - All of the above

33. **Additional writing stats**: Should other metrics be shown?
    - Sentence count
    - Paragraph count
    - Variable count (already planned)
    - Reading grade level (e.g., "8th grade reading level")
    - None (keep it simple)

### Under Consideration

**Updated based on Session 2 feedback:**

‚úÖ **APPROVED - Moving to implementation:**
- Template Analytics (P0 - Critical, v1.2)
- Template Versioning System (P0 - Critical, v1.2)
- Template Snippets (P2, v1.3)
- Tab Grouping by Campaign (P2, v1.2)
- Folder + Tag Hybrid Organization (P2, v1.3)

ü§î **STILL UNDER CONSIDERATION:**
- **Smart Suggestions via Browser AI**: Leverage Chrome/Edge local AI APIs (nice-to-have, explore in v2.0)
- **Batch Operations**: Apply changes to multiple templates at once (need to think more)
- **Command Menu Expansion**: Improve/expand `/` command plugins (already exists, just needs enhancement)

‚ùå **REJECTED - Not needed for MVP:**
- Inline Spell Check (Edge does this automatically)
- Real-time Collaboration (too complex for MVP)
- Template Testing (not needed)

## Design Sessions & Decisions

### Session 1: Initial UX Audit & Recommendations
**Discussion Date**: October 28, 2025
**Status**: Awaiting User Feedback

#### Context Discovered

**Architecture Overview:**
- **Editor Framework**: Lexical (Meta's modern rich text editor)
- **Component System**: Feature-based architecture with clear separation
  - Apps (TemplateEditor)
  - Core UI (primitives, constructs, layouts)
  - Domain logic (variables, templates, storage)
- **Storage Strategy**: localStorage with Template Registry system
  - System templates (app-provided, auto-restore)
  - Agency templates (future: org-level)
  - User templates (personal, preserved)
- **Design System**: Side panel-first (360px-800px), 13px base typography, 4px spacing scale
- **Template Types**: Email and SMS with variable insertion

**Current User Workflows:**

1. **Create Mode** (Template Building):
   - Select Email/SMS type
   - Use Lexical editor with variable insertion
   - Variables rendered as blue pill components `{{variable_name}}`
   - Save as template to registry
   - Switch between templates via tab system

2. **Use Mode** (Message Composition):
   - Load template
   - Fill form inputs for each variable
   - Preview with variables replaced
   - Copy final message to clipboard

**Technical Highlights:**
- Custom `TemplateVariableNode` extending Lexical's `DecoratorNode`
- Inline editing of variables with Enter/Escape handling
- Smart cursor positioning after variable insertion
- contentEditable disabled on inputs (brilliant password manager avoidance!)
- Undo/redo with Lexical's HistoryPlugin
- Auto-save with dirty state tracking
- VS Code-inspired tab system with drag-and-drop

#### UX Observations

**‚úÖ Current Strengths:**

1. **Excellent Variable Insertion Pattern**
   - `{{` trigger is intuitive for users familiar with templating
   - Inline editing on click is efficient
   - Clear visual distinction (blue pills)

2. **Solid Information Architecture**
   - Clear mode separation (Create vs Use)
   - Logical sidebar grouping (variables, outline, settings)
   - Tags for template organization

3. **Thoughtful Technical Decisions**
   - Disabling contentEditable to avoid password manager interference = genius
   - Using Lexical's AST for reliable state management
   - Separate storage keys for template types (system/agency/user)

4. **Good Productivity Features**
   - Keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+W to close tabs, Cmd+Tab to switch)
   - Auto-save with dirty indicators
   - Command palette for quick actions
   - Backup/restore functionality

5. **Responsive Side Panel Design**
   - 13px base font optimized for information density
   - 4px spacing scale allows compact layouts
   - Breakpoint system for 360px-800px range

**‚ùå Current Pain Points:**

1. **Terminology Confusion**
   - **"Editor" vs "Compose" modes unclear**
     - "Editor" could mean editing templates OR editing messages
     - "Compose" is specific but doesn't clearly distinguish from "Create"
   - **Solution**: Rename to "Template Builder" and "Message Composer" with helpful tooltips

2. **Variable Insertion Overload**
   - **Three methods to insert variables**: `{{` trigger, toolbar button, sidebar
   - **Problem**: Decision paralysis‚Äîusers wonder which method to use
   - **Evidence**: Toolbar has BOTH a "Placeholder Variables" dropdown AND a "Templates" dropdown‚Äîoverlapping purposes
   - **Solution**: Pick ONE primary method, make others secondary

3. **Variable Discoverability in Compose Mode**
   - **Problem**: Variables look like static text‚Äîusers may not realize they're editable
   - **Evidence**: No hover state, cursor doesn't change to pointer
   - **Solution**: Add hover effects (scale, glow, cursor change)

4. **No Preview Before Sending**
   - **Problem**: In Compose mode, users fill form then copy‚Äîno final preview step
   - **Risk**: Typos or formatting issues not caught before sending
   - **Solution**: Add collapsible preview panel showing final message

5. **Character Counter Only for SMS**
   - **Problem**: Counter only appears for SMS type, but email length matters too
   - **Insight**: Long emails get cut off in mobile previews (typically ~140 chars)
   - **Solution**: Always show character count in editor footer

6. **Tab Overload Potential**
   - **Problem**: With 15+ templates, tabs become overwhelming
   - **Evidence**: Current tab system has no limits or grouping
   - **Solution**: Add "Recently Used" section, pin favorites, max 10 open tabs

7. **Variable Form UX in Compose Mode**
   - **Problem**: Long variable lists create scroll fatigue
   - **Evidence**: INSURANCE_VARIABLES has 15+ fields
   - **Solution**: Collapsible sections, autofocus first empty field

8. **No Undo for Template Deletion**
   - **Problem**: Deleting templates from sidebar is permanent
   - **Risk**: Accidental deletion of important templates
   - **Solution**: Add "Recently Deleted" section (30-day retention)

9. **Tag Management Friction**
   - **Problem**: No inline tag creation‚Äîmust open metadata editor
   - **Evidence**: InlineTagEditor exists but not integrated into main flow
   - **Solution**: Add tag input directly in template card

10. **Outline Panel Underutilized**
    - **Problem**: TemplateOutlinePanel shows headings, but templates rarely use headings
    - **Opportunity**: Repurpose as "Template Structure" showing variables + word count

#### Recommendations

**Priority 1: Quick Wins (High Impact, Low Effort)**

1. **Rename Modes for Clarity** ‚ö°
   - Change "Editor" ‚Üí "Template Builder"
   - Change "Compose" ‚Üí "Message Composer"

   - For SMS: show char count + segment count (160 per segment)
   - **Impact**: Prevents overly long messages
   - **Effort**: 2 hours (refactor TemplateCharacterCounter)

4. **Simplify Variable Insertion** ‚ö°
   - **Remove** toolbar "Placeholder Variables" dropdown
   - **Keep**: `{{` trigger (primary) + sidebar (secondary, for browsing)
   - Add tooltip in empty editor: "Type {{ to insert a variable"
   - **Impact**: Reduces decision paralysis
   - **Effort**: 1 hour (remove toolbar menu, add empty state hint)

5. **Add Preview Panel in Compose Mode** ‚ö°
   - Collapsible panel below form (ResizablePanel)
   - Shows final message with variables filled
   - Updates live as user types in form
   - **Impact**: Catch errors before sending, build confidence

#### Design Patterns Library

**Variable Insertion Patterns** (To be refined based on user feedback)

Current pattern:
- Trigger: `{{` opens variable menu
- Select: Arrow keys + Enter
- Render: Blue pill with label
- Edit: Click to open inline input

Proposed improvements:
- Add keyboard shortcut: `Cmd+Shift+V` to open variable picker
- Add recent variables section (last 5 used)
- Add variable descriptions in picker (not just labels)

**Template Card Pattern**

Current:
```
[Template Name]
Tags: [tag1] [tag2]
[Preview text...]
```

Proposed:
```
[Template Name]               [Type badge: Email/SMS]
[Inline tag editor: +tag]
[Preview text... (first 100 chars)]
[Footer: Last used: 2 days ago | Used 12 times]
```

**Compose Form Pattern**

Current: Vertical list of all variables

Proposed:
```
Client Information ‚ñº
  First Name: [____]
  Last Name:  [____]

Policy Details ‚ñº
  Policy Type: [____]
  Coverage:    [____]

[Preview Panel ‚ñº]
```

#### Open Questions for User

*See "Outstanding Questions & Decisions" section above for full list.*

**Top 5 Most Critical:**
1. What should modes be called? (Template Builder vs Design Mode?)
2. Which variable insertion method feels most natural to YOUR users?
3. How many templates does a typical user manage?
4. What happens after composing a message? (Email integration? CRM export?)
5. Do users need to CREATE custom variables, or only use predefined ones?

### Session 2: User Feedback & Prioritization
**Discussion Date**: October 28, 2025
**Decision Date**: October 28, 2025
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete

#### Summary of Decisions Made

**All 26 questions from Session 1 have been answered!** This session focuses on documenting decisions, updating priorities, and identifying new questions for the next implementation phase.

#### Critical Discovery: Template Performance Tracking is Core

**User Quote:** *"One of the core features is tracking template performance and tweaking/refining which templates drive the best results across campaigns."*

**Implication:** Template versioning and analytics are **NOT** nice-to-have features‚Äîthey are **CORE** to the product value proposition. Priority has been elevated from P3 (v2.0) to **P0 (Critical, v1.2)**.

#### Decisions by Category

**‚úÖ TERMINOLOGY & MENTAL MODELS**

1. **Mode Names: APPROVED**
   - **Decision**: "Template Builder" + "Message Composer"
   - **Rationale**: User confirmed these names provide clarity
   - **Action**: Rename in UI + add tooltips ("Build reusable templates" | "Fill and send messages")
   - **Priority**: P1 (v1.1)

2. **Target Users: DEFINED**
   - **Decision**: Insurance agents and team members, tech level 6/10
   - **Rationale**: Moderate tech-savviness‚Äîneed balance of power features + discoverability
   - **Impact**: Don't oversimplify UI, but provide helpful onboarding/tooltips
   - **Design Consideration**: Progressive disclosure works well for this user level

3. **Template Ownership: ROADMAP DEFINED**
   - **Decision**: Multi-tier ownership structure
     - **v1.x**: Personal templates (user-only)
     - **v1.3-2.0**: Agency templates (org-wide, requires approval workflow)
     - **v3.0**: Cross-agency/public templates (knowledge sharing platform)
   - **Rationale**: Phased rollout allows MVP first, then team features, then ecosystem
   - **Priority**: Personal (v1.1), Agency (v1.3), Public (v3.0)

4. **Usage Frequency: BEHAVIOR INSIGHTS**
   - **Decision**: Users reuse daily, create infrequently
   - **User Quote**: *"I would like to encourage creating new templates by adding analytics‚Äîusage count this week."*
   - **Implication**: Analytics is not just tracking‚Äîit's a **behavior driver** to encourage template creation
   - **Action**: Show "This template used 12 times this week" prominently on template cards
   - **Priority**: P0 (v1.2) - Critical for driving desired behavior

**‚úÖ VARIABLE SYSTEM**

5. **Variable Insertion Methods: KEEP ALL THREE**
   - **Decision**: Keep `{{` trigger + toolbar button + sidebar
   - **Rationale**: User prefers flexibility over simplification
   - **Reversal**: Session 1 recommended removing toolbar dropdown‚ÄîREJECTED
   - **Action**: Keep all three, but add tooltips to guide new users to primary method (`{{`)
   - **Priority**: P1 (v1.1) - Add tooltips only

6. **Variable Grouping: ALREADY IMPLEMENTED**
   - **Decision**: Group variables with accordion lists
   - **User Quote**: *"I grouped them to add accordion lists to help minimize cognitive load."*
   - **Validation**: User already thought through this‚Äîgood UX instinct
   - **Action**: Ensure grouping is prominent in both sidebar AND compose form
   - **Priority**: P1 (v1.1) - Enhance existing grouping

7. **Custom Variables: REQUIRED**
   - **Decision**: Support BOTH predefined + custom variables
   - **Rationale**: Predefined covers common cases, custom allows flexibility
   - **New Questions**: Where to create? What fields required? Global or template-scoped?
   - **Priority**: P2 (v1.3) - Needs design spec first

8. **Conditional Variables: NOT NECESSARY**
   - **Decision**: No if/then logic needed
   - **Rationale**: Adds complexity without clear use case
   - **Action**: Remove from roadmap
   - **Priority**: N/A (REJECTED)

**‚úÖ TEMPLATE MANAGEMENT**

9. **Template Volume: 10-50 TYPICAL, 50+ POWER USERS**
   - **Decision**: Design for 10-50 templates, support 50+ for edge cases
   - **Implication**: Tab limits would hurt power users‚ÄîDO NOT limit tabs
   - **Reversal**: Session 1 recommended 10-tab limit‚ÄîREJECTED
   - **Action**: Provide organizational tools (folders, tags, search) instead of artificial limits
   - **Priority**: P2 (v1.3) - Folder + tag system

10. **Organization: FOLDERS + TAGS HYBRID**
    - **Decision**: Implement BOTH folders AND tags
    - **User Quote**: *"Users are not typically familiar with tag use. But very familiar with folders."*
    - **Rationale**: Tags are powerful but unfamiliar‚Äîfolders provide familiar mental model
    - **Recommendation**: Folders primary, tags secondary (filter/cross-cutting)
    - **New Questions**: Folder depth? Primary navigation method? Interaction pattern?
    - **Priority**: P2 (v1.3) - Needs design spec first

11. **Template Versioning: üî¥ CRITICAL FEATURE**
    - **Decision**: Full version history with performance tracking
    - **User Quote**: *"Absolutely. One of the core features is tracking template performance and tweaking/refining which templates drive the best results across campaigns."*
    - **Elevation**: Moved from P3 (v2.0) to **P0 (Critical, v1.2)**
    - **Rationale**: Not a nice-to-have‚ÄîCORE product value
    - **Scope**: Version history + diff view + restore + performance comparison
    - **New Questions**: Display location? Auto-save vs manual? Retention policy?
    - **Priority**: **P0 (v1.2)** - Must build immediately after v1.1

12. **Template Sharing: APPROVAL WORKFLOW REQUIRED**
    - **Decision**: Users can submit templates to Team Leads for agency-wide approval
    - **User Quote**: *"They can submit to Agent or Team Lead to add to Agency Default templates."*
    - **Scope**: Submission UI + approval queue + notifications + feedback loop
    - **New Questions**: Submission process? Approval UI? Notification method? Change requests?
    - **Priority**: P2 (v1.3) - After folders/versioning

13. **Template Archiving: REQUIRED**
    - **Decision**: Support archiving (hide without delete)
    - **Rationale**: Users accumulate templates over time‚Äîneed to reduce clutter without losing data
    - **Pattern**: Archive section in sidebar (collapsed by default)
    - **Priority**: P2 (v1.2)

**‚úÖ COMPOSE/USAGE FLOW**

14. **Preview Timing: ON-DEMAND TOGGLE**
    - **Decision**: Collapsible preview panel (not always visible)
    - **Rationale**: Saves screen space, user can show/hide as needed
    - **Pattern**: ResizablePanel below compose form, remembers user preference
    - **Priority**: P1 (v1.1)

15. **Export Options: CLIPBOARD ONLY (FOR NOW)**
    - **Decision**: Copy to clipboard only in MVP
    - **Future**: Email/CRM/SMS integrations after 3rd party vendor approval
    - **Rationale**: Vendor approval process takes time‚Äîdon't block MVP
    - **Roadmap**: v1.x clipboard, v2.0+ integrations
    - **Priority**: P1 (v1.1) - Keep simple

16. **Recipient Management: SINGLE RECIPIENT (FLEXIBLE INPUT)**
    - **Decision**: Single recipient, but allow multiple names typed into one field
    - **User Quote**: *"I just assumed the single recipient could be expanded to include multiple customer names just by typing them in. No need to add additional variable fields that would add another click/navigation point."*
    - **Rationale**: Keep flow simple, avoid adding complexity
    - **Pattern**: Accept comma-separated names in one input
    - **Priority**: P1 (v1.1) - Document behavior

17. **Compose from Scratch: ‚úÖ REQUIRED**
    - **Decision**: Users must be able to compose messages WITHOUT templates
    - **Rationale**: Not every message fits a template‚Äîneed flexibility
    - **Action**: Add "Blank Message" option in mode switcher
    - **Pattern**: Opens empty editor in Message Composer mode
    - **Priority**: P1 (v1.1) - **NEW FEATURE** (high priority)

**‚úÖ CHARACTER COUNTING ‚Üí WORD COUNTING**

18-20. **Word Count Preferred Over Character Count**
    - **Decision**: Replace character counter with WORD counter
    - **User Quote**: *"I think word count is more effective measurement to indicate how long a message is."*
    - **Rationale**: RCS protocol = no SMS limits, word count more intuitive for message length
    - **Reversal**: Session 1 recommended "always show character counter"‚ÄîCHANGED to word counter
    - **New Questions**: Word count only, or + character count? Add reading time? Other stats?
    - **Priority**: P1 (v1.1) - Simple refactor

**‚úÖ TAB MANAGEMENT**

21. **Tab Limits: NO LIMITS**
    - **Decision**: Do NOT impose artificial tab limits
    - **Rationale**: Power users manage 50+ templates, need flexibility
    - **Reversal**: Session 1 recommended 10-tab limit‚ÄîREJECTED
    - **Alternative Solution**: Provide organizational tools (grouping, recently used) instead
    - **Priority**: P2 (v1.2) - Tab grouping system

22. **Tab Grouping: ‚úÖ WANTED (NEEDS DESIGN HELP)**
    - **Decision**: Implement tab grouping by campaign/project
    - **User Quote**: *"That'd be awesome, but I didn't want to expend the brain power to figure out how to implement this properly. If you can do it for me, that'd be great."*
    - **Opportunity**: User explicitly requested design help‚Äîhigh engagement signal
    - **New Questions**: Auto vs manual grouping? UI pattern? Persistence?
    - **Priority**: P2 (v1.2) - Needs design spec ASAP

23. **Recently Closed Tabs: REQUIRED**
    - **Decision**: Support recovering closed tabs (like browser Ctrl+Shift+T)
    - **Rationale**: Prevents accidental tab close frustration
    - **New Questions**: Access method? Retention count? Persistence across sessions?
    - **Priority**: P2 (v1.2)

**‚úÖ ACCESSIBILITY & PRODUCTIVITY**

24. **Keyboard Shortcuts: SPECIFIC LIST PROVIDED**
    - **Decision**: Critical shortcuts identified
      - Tab navigation
      - Enter to submit
      - Ctrl+S to save
      - Ctrl+K to search
      - `/` to open command menu
      - Arrow navigation
    - **Action**: Audit current shortcuts, fill gaps (Ctrl+N, Ctrl+D, Ctrl+F, Esc)
    - **New Questions**: Additional shortcuts needed? User customization?
    - **Priority**: P2 (v1.2)

25. **Screen Reader Support: ‚úÖ REQUIRED FOR VENDOR APPROVAL**
    - **Decision**: Implement screen reader support (WCAG 2.1 AA)
    - **User Quote**: *"Need to get 3rd party vendor approval so I think this would help."*
    - **Rationale**: Vendor approval likely requires accessibility compliance
    - **Scope**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, semantic HTML, focus management
    - **New Questions**: Priority areas? WCAG level (AA vs AAA)?
    - **Priority**: P2 (v1.3) - Before vendor submission

26. **Mobile Usage: ‚ùå NOT SUPPORTED (SECURITY)**
    - **Decision**: Desktop-only, no mobile/tablet support
    - **User Quote**: *"Would be a security nightmare. I plan on limiting logins from specific domains‚Äîleaning on enterprise hardware security policies for data security compliance. This is primarily for State Farm agencies."*
    - **Rationale**: Sensitive insurance data requires enterprise security‚Äîmobile too risky
    - **Impact**: No need for mobile-responsive design (side panel widths sufficient)
    - **Priority**: N/A (REJECTED for security reasons)

## UX Principles for This Project

[To be refined based on user feedback and design sessions]

### Core Principles Discovered

1. **Side Panel-First Design**
   - Optimize for 360px-800px widths
   - Primary target: 480px (comfortable for most users)
   - Information density matters: 13px base font, tight spacing

2. **Keyboard-First Productivity**
   - Power users should never need mouse
   - Shortcuts for common actions (Cmd+W, Cmd+Tab, {{)
   - Command palette for discoverability

3. **Progressive Disclosure**
   - Don't overwhelm with all options at once
   - Show advanced features only when needed
   - Contextual help and tooltips

4. **Forgiving by Default**
   - Auto-save everything
   - Undo/redo always available
   - Soft deletes with recovery period
   - Dirty indicators prevent data loss

5. **Content-First**
   - Editor takes center stage
   - Minimize chrome and decoration
   - Let the message be the focus

**NEW PRINCIPLES FROM SESSION 2:**

6. **Data-Driven Template Refinement**
   - Show usage metrics prominently to drive behavior
   - Analytics isn't just reporting‚Äîit's a behavior driver
   - Performance comparison enables experimentation ("performance lab" mindset)
   - User quote: "I would like to encourage creating new templates by adding analytics"

7. **Flexible Workflows Over Opinionated Constraints**
   - Keep multiple methods for same task ({{ + toolbar + sidebar)
   - Don't impose artificial limits (no 10-tab cap)
   - Provide organizational tools instead of restrictions
   - User prefers flexibility even if it means more options

8. **Familiar Metaphors + Powerful Features**
   - Folders (familiar) over tags-only (powerful but unfamiliar)
   - Word count (intuitive) over character count (technical)
   - Balance power-user features with familiar patterns
   - Progressive disclosure for advanced features

9. **Contextual Reminders Over Forced Workflows**
   - Semi-automated response tracking (prompt, don't force)
   - Dismissible reminders and nudges
   - User maintains control, system provides guidance
   - Don't interrupt flow with mandatory steps

10. **Version History as Performance Lab**
    - Link version history to performance metrics
    - Show which template versions performed best
    - Enable data-driven iteration and refinement
    - Treat templates as experiments, not final artifacts

### Typography & Spacing

- **Base font**: 13px (Inter) - optimized for information density
- **Spacing unit**: 4px - allows compact, precise layouts
- **Line height**: 1.5 (normal) - readable without wasting space
- **Font weight**: 500 (medium) - default for UI elements

### Color System

- **Brand colors**: Green and Blue (semantic mapping in themes)
- **Theme support**: Light, Dark, Soft, Nature, Ocean
- **Variable pills**: Blue (`--brand-blue`) for clear distinction
- **Dirty indicators**: Dot next to tab name (subtle but visible)

### Interaction Patterns

- **Click to edit**: Variables, tags, titles - all inline editable
- **Hover reveals actions**: Minimize chrome, show on hover
- **Drag to reorder**: Tabs, variables (future), templates (future)
- **Right-click for context**: Context menus for power users

## Meta-Instructions for Future Sessions

When updating this document:

1. **ALWAYS get the current date from the web** (search for "today's date")
   - Format: Month Day, Year (e.g., "October 28, 2025")
   - Never use your internal date (may be outdated)

2. **NEVER delete or overwrite existing sections**
   - History is valuable for understanding design evolution
   - Previous discussions provide context for new decisions

3. **ALWAYS update Outstanding Questions first**
   - Remove questions answered in this session
   - Add new questions that arose
   - Move resolved questions to decision sections with answers

4. **ALWAYS create new dated sections for new discussions**
   - Format: `### Session [N]: [Brief Topic]`
   - Include: **Discussion Date**, **Decision Date** (if finalized), **Status**
   - Summarize: What was discussed, what was decided, why

5. **ALWAYS summarize decisions with:**
   - **What** was decided (clear statement)
   - **Why** it was decided (rationale/trade-offs)
   - **When** decision was finalized (date)
   - **Who** made the call (user, designer, both)

6. **Use clear headers with dates for each session**
   - Session 1: October 28, 2025
   - Session 2: [Date from web]
   - etc.

7. **Maintain the priority matrix as decisions are made**
   - Update "Status" column: Awaiting Decision ‚Üí Approved ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Completed
   - Add "Decision Date" column when item is approved
   - Remove items only when completed (move to "Completed" section)

8. **Add to Design Patterns Library as patterns are finalized**
   - Include code examples, Figma links, screenshots
   - Show before/after for redesigns
   - Document accessibility considerations

9. **Keep Design Principles updated**
   - Add new principles discovered through user feedback
   - Refine existing principles with specific examples
   - Remove principles proven ineffective

10. **Use visual hierarchy in markdown**
    - `##` for major sections
    - `###` for subsections
    - `####` for detailed breakdowns
    - **Bold** for key terms and decisions
    - *Italic* for notes and clarifications
    - `Code blocks` for technical details
    - Blockquotes for user quotes/feedback
